Program in C: The principle is described above, implementation in C is simplified:
There is a sha1 hash that returns a string (I didn't find exactly the hashes I write about above in C).
I have prepared an int list [12] for you, where you do not have to work with words, but with numbers: 1, 2, ... 12 (these numbers represent words, see comment).
The function prepared by me will replace the given words according to these numbers.
The numbers cannot be repeated in the list, each is there exactly once.
Searched public key hash is: d99fa327540d376faf85ffb64bfe95c0191a428f (is entered in the code entry)

!! Open the program via the project icon (not main), although it is C ++, but use the classic C commands (that's how I programmed it).
You can implement everything only in the main.

Tip: all options are 12! = 479 001 600, my algorithm / program will run all in about 35.5 minutes!
To avoid the feeling that you have made a mistake and have an endless cycle, give yourself a progress bar, eg after each
In 4,790,016 attempts, progress increases by 1 (1%).

Interesting fact: If there were no condition that words / numbers cannot be repeated, my program would go through all the possibilities in about 1.25 years.
